# 🌟 StarkFPI - Cross-Border Payment Intent Solver

StarkFPI is an innovative payment solution built as a Telegram Mini App, leveraging Starknet to bridge the gap between international travelers and local UPI payments in India. By integrating directly with Telegram's 1 billion+ user base and utilizing AI agents and ZK proofs, our platform enables seamless cross-border transactions while ensuring security and dispute resolution.

## 🚀 Project Overview

StarkFPI solves a crucial problem for foreign travelers in India who want to use the ubiquitous UPI payment system but don't have Indian Rupees (INR). Our platform acts as a decentralized intent solver marketplace, similar to Uber's architecture, where local solvers can fulfill payment intents and receive Starknet tokens in return.

## 📈 Key Features

* 📱 **Telegram Mini App**: Seamless integration with Telegram's platform, reaching 1B+ users
* 🔄 **Cross-Border UPI Payments**: Enable foreigners to make UPI payments without holding INR
* 🤖 **AI Agent Intent Solving**: Smart matching of payment intents with local solvers
* ⚡ **Real-Time Settlement**: Instant processing using Starknet's Layer 2 solution
* 🛡️ **ZK Proof Verification**: Secure dispute resolution system using zero-knowledge proofs
* 📱 **QR Code Integration**: Seamless scanning of UPI QR codes through Telegram
* 💱 **Token-to-INR Bridge**: Automatic conversion between Starknet tokens and INR
